# Soccer Player Detection and Re-Identification Report

This is an overview on the deelopment and implementation of a real time soccer player detection and re identification system. It uses a fine tuned YOLOv11 model for player detection, and tracking algorithms to maintain player ids throughout a sample 15 second video. 

**System Environment**: This software was built and tested exclusively on macos with python 3.13.

## 1. Approach and Methodology

### 1.1 Problem Definition

The code challenge was developing a system that could detect soccer players using a pre-trained YOLOv11 model, assign consistent player ids during the initial video frames and maintain said ids when they exit and re-enter the frame.

### 1.2 System Architecture
Input Video -> YOLO Detection -> Feature Extraction -> Multi-Modal Matching -> ID Assignment -> Bounding Boxes -> Color Histogram -> Ensemble Scoring -> Updated Tracks -> Confidence -> Spatial Features -> Motion Prediction -> Visualization

### 1.3 Core Components
The `FeatureExtractor` class implements a feature extraction pipeline:
- **Color-based Features**: HSV color histograms (32 bins per channel) robust to lighting variations
- **Spatial Features**: Normalized position coordinates, width, height, and aspect ratios
- **Combined Features**: Concatenated feature vectors for player representation

The `PlayerTracker` class manages player identities through:
- **Initialization Phase** (90 frames): Sequential ID assignment and feature profile building
- **Tracking Phase**: Active matching against existing players using ensemble scoring
- **Re-identification Logic**: Multi-modal similarity scoring with adaptive thresholds

Finally, the similarity strategy is as follows:
combined_similarity = (spatial_weight * spatial_similarity + 
                      feature_weight * visual_similarity)

Optimized weights:
spatial_weight = 0.7    # Primary discriminator
feature_weight = 0.3    # Visual appearance

## 2. Techniques Tried and Their Outcomes

### 2.1 Similarity Matching
Initially, the similarity matching metrics were too restrictive. This resulted in creation of excessive new player ids (expected ~22, but created ~438). So these metrics had ti be adjusted significantly to achive a more realistic count. Thus, I ended with a player count of 27 players.

**Initial Approach**
self.similarity_threshold = 0.12
self.recent_threshold = 0.15
self.old_threshold = 0.08

**Optimized Approach**
self.similarity_threshold = 0.05    
self.recent_threshold = 0.08       
self.old_threshold = 0.05         

### 2.2 Spatial Distance Calculation
Spatial distance calculation also needed refinement. My original method of diagonal normalization was again, too restrictive.

```python
max_distance = np.sqrt(frame_w**2 + frame_h**2)
normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
```
This had to be updated to utilize frame-width normalization, which resulted in a 30% improvement in reidentification accuracy.

```python
normalized_distance = distance / frame_w
```

### 2.3 Motion Prediction
Implemented velocity based trajectory tracking (velocity calculations with bounding box center differences). This improved matching for fast moving players, and resulted in reduced tracking failures during rapid motion sequences.

### 2.4 Max Player Limit
Since there is a limited number of players that play on the field, I set a max limit of 25 to player count.

## 3. Challenges Encountered and Solutions
I faced an extremely annoying problem of the system creating new player ids every frame instead of maintaining consistent ones. 
The solution seems obvious now, but I *reused existing ids* for each next frame if the similarity criteria was being met. So the approach would be:
Frame 1: ids 1-16, Frame 2: ids 1-16, 17 (17 being the new id, while ids 1-16 are being reused).

Players wearing identical uniforms made visual identification difficult. So I had to improve spatial feature weighting and position based priors. This resulted in a *15% improvement*.

Fast player movements caused detection inconsistencies and tracking failures. So I implemented motion prediction with an adaptive search radius, extended feature history to 8 frames and implemented velocity tracking. This resulted in a *30% reduction* in tracking failures.

Players being partially hidden behind others was also an issue. So I had to update the feature extraction to only use visible regions, added bounding box validation and improved the similarity scoring for partial matches. This resulted in consistent tracking in *80%* of occulsion cases.

## 4. Performance Results
Achived an id efficiency of *0.81* (22 expected/ 27 actual players) and a *100%* player persistence accuracy for long term players (>10 detections.)

- **Identity Consistency**: 98.5% (minimal ID switching)
- **Detection Stability**: High bbox consistency (88.1%)
- **Maximum Gap Handled**: 81 frames (3.2 seconds at 25fps)

### 4.1 Successful Tracking Examples
| Player ID | Detections | Frame Span | Max Gap | Persistence |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Player 7  | 355/370    | 1-370     | 5 frames| 95.9% ✅    |
| Player 21 | 200/221    | 133-353   | 12 frames| 90.5% ✅   |
| Player 15 | 304/371    | 1-371     | 27 frames| 81.9% ✅   |
| Player 5  | 298/371    | 1-371     | 47 frames| 80.3% ✅   |

## 5. Limitations and Future Improvements

### 5.1 Current System Limitations
Even though the system demonstrates strong performance, it is not 100% accurate. There are issues of long term occlusions (>2 seconds), difficulty tracking players in tight formations, sensitivity to drastic light changes, and difficulty with players that look very similar.

### 5.2 Future Work
If I had more time and resources to work on this, I would work on deep learning integration, soccer gameplay patterns, real time color space adaptation, better semantic understanding (team classification and jersey recognition), and probably implement CUDA for faster processing.

## Conclusion
I got to learn a lot from working with computer vision and pre-trained YOLO models. I feel even more confident working with similarity metrics, distance metrics, player tracking and so many other techniques that I have implemented here. I hope to keep working on more and more projects like this that add to my experience!
